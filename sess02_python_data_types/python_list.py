Python Lists
A Python List is a built in data type that represents an ordered collection of items / elements,
that are homogeneous in nature.
Lists allow duplicates and are mutable (i.e their elements can be modified, added or removed)
Lists are created using [] or list() constructor
A sample list and some of its operations are given below
"""

# Create a list of fruits
