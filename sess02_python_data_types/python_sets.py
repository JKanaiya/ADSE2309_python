"""
Python sets
A set in python is a built in type that represents an unordered collection of elements of the same or different types
Sets DONT allow duplicates and are mutable. Theyare suitable fro tasks that involve checking membership, removing
duplicates and perfroming mathematical operations like intersection, uniion, difference and symmetric_difference

Sets are created  using the curcly braces {} or set() constructor
